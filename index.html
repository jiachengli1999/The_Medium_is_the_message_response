        <!-- -the medium is more important than the content 
        -today: the medium, social media, changes the way we think and behave 
        -for example- what we post online matters- deleting may not change much since it can be stored
            -hence, we have to be careful on what we post- this can result in job losses etc. 
            -likewise, everything is monitored now so we also have to be careful on what we do outside
                -China for example, monitoring its citizens and giving them a score
        -The medium can have impact on more people in that it changes how we behave, 
        but the content can be more important depending on the individual
