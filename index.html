                Marshall McLuhan argues that the medium is more important than the content.
                Despite not living during the times of social media, his argument fits well with 
                the current era. For example, social media surrounds us today, and it is a medium 
                that provides us with a variety of content. What makes social media important is that 
                it has impacted everyone socially and economically. Job hunting has moved to online 
                applications, and we connect with people through apps. What we post today also matters 
                significantly, as deleting them online may not have much of an effect. Everything
                that is sent online is documented. Likewise, everything is monitored now so we also have to 
                be careful on our actions. China for example, monitors its citizens and gives them a score.
                Hence, the medium influences our actions.

                However, the content can be more important depending on the individual. 
                Marshall McLuhan describes a lightbulb as a medium without content. It brings
                light to society, and allows us to see in the night. Although the lightbulb 
                by itself does not have content, we can give it meaning. In the film, "Parasite," the lightbulb 
                was used to deliver morse code messages. This is meaningless to people who don't know morse code, 
                but it is significant to people who do. Since the lightbulb is a main source of communication, I 
                would say that the context of the lightbulb is more important than the medium. The medium could be 
                anything as long as the morse code can be made.
